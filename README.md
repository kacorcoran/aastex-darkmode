# AASTeX-darkmode
A modified class file for creating dark mode manuscripts in all your favorite AAS journal styles.  The repository also includes some other stuff used in drafting an arXiv paper detailing dark mode papers.

Please note that I do not own the license to the actual AASTeX class file, and I am not affiliated with its upkeep in any way.  `aastex631dm.cls` is a modified version of this class file, last modified Mar. 29, 2022, which contains details of the modifications made to the actual class file.  A copy of the original AASTeX class file is included in this repository and can also be found at https://journals.aas.org/aastex-package-for-manuscript-preparation/. Any official dark mode class file would need to be distributed through the journals that chose to add dark mode.

`aa_url_dm.bst` is a modified version of a modified `aa.bst` which can be found at https://github.com/yangcht/AA-bibstyle-with-hyperlink, and the modified `aa.bst` is a modified version of the real `aa.bst` which can be found at http://ftp.edpsciences.org/pub/aa/readme.html.
