# AASTeX-darkmode
A modified class file for creating dark mode manuscripts in all your favorite AAS journal styles.  The repository also includes some other stuff used in drafting an arXiv paper detailing dark mode papers.

Please note that I do not own the copyright to the actual AASTeX class file, and I am not affiliated with its upkeep.  aastex631dm.cls is a modified version of this class file, last modified Mar. 29, 2022.  Any official dark mode class file would need to be distributed through the journals that chose to add dark mode.
